# What news

It've been some time since [first introducing of Sheetbase](https://medium.com/@lamnhan/introducing-sheetbase-a-new-way-to-build-websites-and-apps-c6a6bccb6254), the feedback is great, so we decided to push the flatform further with rebuilding mostly every part, includes:

- Using Typescript.
- Modular packages (server modules: Core, Sheets, Drive, Gmail, API Key, ...).
- Redesign theme system.
- Official [Javascript client](https://github.com/sheetbase/client) (w/ framework wrappers: [Angular](https://github.com/sheetbase/angular), ...).
- Re-build the CLI.

Hope you enjoy! Love <3
